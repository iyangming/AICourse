# Workbook 4: PyTorch Fundamentals

This workbook covers the fundamentals of PyTorch, including tensors, datasets, models, and training loops.

## Project Structure

- `introduction.ipynb` / `introduction.md`: Introduction to PyTorch concepts.
- `tensor.ipynb` / `tensor.md`: Working with PyTorch Tensors.
- `quick_start.ipynb` / `quick_start.md`: A quick guide to getting started with PyTorch for image classification (likely MNIST).
- `transforms.ipynb` / `transforms.md`: Data transformations in PyTorch.
- `model.ipynb` / `model.md`: Building neural network models in PyTorch.
- `train.ipynb` / `train.md`: Training models in PyTorch.
- `save_load.ipynb` / `save_load.md`: Saving and loading models in PyTorch.
- `MNIST_Data/`: Directory for storing the MNIST dataset.
- `images/`: Contains images and diagrams used in the notebooks/markdown files.
- `model.ckpt`: A saved model checkpoint.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for this workbook.

## Objectives

- Understand core PyTorch components.
- Learn how to build, train, and evaluate neural networks using PyTorch.
- Practice with common datasets like MNIST.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Run the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) or view the markdown files (`.md` files).
