# Iris Classification with MindSpore

This project implements Iris flower classification using a neural network built with MindSpore.

## Project Objective

The main goal is to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements using a MindSpore neural network.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets` is used for this project.

## Model Architecture

Details of the neural network architecture will be described here (e.g., number of layers, activation functions).

## Training Process

Information about the training process, including optimizer, loss function, and number of epochs.

## Experimental Results

Discussion of the model's performance, including accuracy and any visualizations.

## Files

- `iris_mindspore_nn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the MindSpore implementation.
- `iris_mindspore_nn.py`: Python script version of the MindSpore implementation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for this project.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python and MindSpore installed.
2.  Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Run the Jupyter notebook `iris_mindspore_nn.ipynb` or the Python script `iris_mindspore_nn.py`.
